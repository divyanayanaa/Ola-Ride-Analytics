Ola Ride Insights Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing ride-sharing operations using SQL and Power BI to uncover actionable business insights. The dashboard evaluates ride performance, customer behavior, and pricing patterns to support data-driven decision-making.

Key analyses include identifying peak demand hours, understanding ride completion and cancellation trends, monitoring payment failures, and assessing driver availability and allocation efficiency. The insights help highlight operational bottlenecks such as driver cancellations and transaction issues.

Based on the analysis, data-driven recommendations were provided to optimize driver allocation, reduce payment failures, and improve overall customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
